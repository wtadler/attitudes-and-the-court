# Notes on (racial) discrimintion legal data

## File: race_discrimination_panel_level.dta

* 100 cases
* panelvote column codes for anti-discrimination votes
* very limited date range: 1995 - 2004


## File: affirmative_action_panel_level.dta

* 153 cases
* panelvote column codes for pro affirmative action votes
* date range: 1980 - 2003
* potential problem: perhaps not all of these are race-based (although all of those I checked were..)
