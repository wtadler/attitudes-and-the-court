Although we used several modeling approaches, we did not find a relationship between federal court rulings dealing with gender discrimination and societal attitudes about gender roles. It may be that most circuit court cases do not reach the public consciousness enough or are not impactful enough to affect attitudes. Alternatively, it is possible that cases in another domain such as affirmative action or the death penalty have a more direct effect on attitudes. Unfortunately, in many domains our current data set did contain sufficient temporal overlap between court cases and relevant GSS questions for a well-powered analysis.

An interesting future direction might be to study this question using supreme court cases, which (sometimes) receive far greater media coverage. For example, did the recent Obergefell v. Hodges ruling alter Americans' views about same-sex marriage? This kind of high-profile case may be the most likely to shift attitudes perceptibly, though this very landmark status also means that such cases are rare, and thus difficult to statistically analyze.
